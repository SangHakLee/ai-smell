# AI Smell Detector

A simple tool to "smell" if a website is potentially generated by AI or uses generic, low-effort templates.

## How it works

It fetches a URL and runs a series of "sniffers" to analyze the page's HTML. Each sniffer looks for specific patterns:

- **Boilerplate:** Detects common framework boilerplate (e.g., "Made with Create React App").
- **UI Kit:** Checks for default themes from popular UI kits (e.g., Bootstrap).
- **Content:** Analyzes text for patterns that might indicate AI-written content.
- **Design:** Looks for common, uncustomized layout patterns.
- **Meta:** Inspects meta tags for AI-related generators.

The results are aggregated into a final "smell score".

## Installation
